## Intro
A 3d-printed macropad for the discerning ergonomic mechanical keyboard enthusiast.

## FAQ
**Q) Why?**

A) It ap-peeled to my sense of humor.

**Q) Is this really ergonomic?**

A) The banana is perfectly shaped to fit the human hand. Checkmate, ortho gang.

**Q) My alphabet of choice has more than 8 characters. How do you expect me to type on this?**

A) Print a bunch!

**Q) Where did you learn your soldering skills?**

A) Sundae school!

**Q) Which key is your favorite?**

A) The mon-key!

**Q) I hate everything about this.**

A) Stop, you're hurting my peelings.

## Construction

### Printed Parts
- [ ] 1x split_a.stl - [https://github.com/dbostian/banana/blob/main/stls/split_a.stl](https://github.com/dbostian/banana/blob/main/stls/split_a.stl)
- [ ] 1x split_b.stl - [https://github.com/dbostian/banana/blob/main/stls/split_b.stl](https://github.com/dbostian/banana/blob/main/stls/split_b.stl)

### Hardware
- [ ] 8x Switches - Cherry MX or compatible.
- [ ] 8x Keycaps
- [ ] 1x Pro Micro
- [ ] 2x M3 x 12mm Socket Cap Machine Screw
- [ ] 2x M3 Heatset Threaded Inserts
- [ ] Sticker (optional)
- [ ] Wire


### Tools / Misc
- [ ] 3d Printer + Filament
- [ ] Soldering Iron + Solder
- [ ] Multimeter
- [ ] Wire Cutters / Strippers / Flush Cutters
- [ ] Hex Drivers

### Printing Notes
Printed in PLA at 0.3 (or finer) layer height. Both halves need support.

### Assembly + Wiring
Install heatset inserts and switches into the top half. There are many ways to wire a macropad. Since this one has only 8 switches, I wired one pin of each directly to individual input pins on the Pro Micro. The other leg of each switch is wired to ground. Diodes are not needed in this case.

### Firmware
The included Arduino sketch is a starting point for a simple macropad. It can be flashed to your microcontroller with the Arduino IDE. You'll probably want to edit this section of the code to send a different strings:


```
...
if (val != states[i]) {
    if (lastChange[i] < (now - DEBOUNCE_TIME)) {
      states[i] = val;
      if (val == LOW) {
        switch(i) {
          case 0:
            Keyboard.print("Ba");
            break;
          case 1:
            Keyboard.print("na");
            break;
          case 2:
            Keyboard.print("na");
            break;
          case 3:
            Keyboard.print("na");
            break;
          case 4:
            Keyboard.print("na");
            break;
          case 5:
            Keyboard.print("na");
            break;
          case 6:
            Keyboard.print("na");
            break;
          case 7:
            Keyboard.print("na!");
            break;
          default:
            break;
        }
        
      } else {
        // On key up
      }
    }    
  }
...
```
